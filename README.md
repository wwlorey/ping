# Programming assignment 2 (pa02)

2. Complete the UDPPinger.pdf activity; 
Complete both optional exercises.
Name your client program `UDP_Pinger_Client.py`.
Name your modified server for optional exercise 2 `UDP_Pinger_Server_Heartbeat.py` and `UPD_Pinger_Client_Heatbeat.py`

For both parts, include the source code and screenshots (in png format) as instructed in each PDF.

General:
* Everything should be in python3.
* It should run in an up-to-date kali VM (and is like fine in your own flavor of Linux).
* All source and text files should be utf-8 with Unix delimiters (if you did the work in the VM and did not copy paste any hidden characters in from your host, it should be fine).
* Include a python shebang and make your source files executable, 
so they can be run like: `./yoursource.py` (example provided in the server code).
* The servey already works.
